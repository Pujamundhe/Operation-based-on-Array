Java Program: 2D Array Manipulation
Overview
This Java program demonstrates basic manipulations with a 2D array:

Declares a 3x3 integer array.
Modifies the array dimensions by changing the size of specific rows.
Prints the modified array's row lengths and contents.
Program Flow
A 2D array num[3][3] is created.
Prints the number of rows in the array (3).
Sets num[0][2] to 19.
Modifies the row sizes:
Row 0 becomes a 1D array with 5 elements.
Row 1 becomes a 1D array with 2 elements.
Prints the modified array's row lengths and contents using nested loops.
